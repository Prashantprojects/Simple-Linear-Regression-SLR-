# 02 Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

Simple Linear Regression.ipynb shows how Simple Linear Regression is applied on a real world data set

Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.ipynb explains what Simple Linear Regression is and how Gradient Descent is used to find the best fit line

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Simple Linear Regression (LSR) and see how it is used in practice. Simple Linear Regression only has 2 variables:

- X : independent feature
- Y: dependent feature

Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent feature and one dependent feature using a straigt line.
- Best to apply Linear Regressin after variable standardization
- Uses Gradient Descent Algortihm to find the best fit line

**Y =wX +B**

Y = Dependent feature\
X = Independent feature\
w = weight\
b = Bias
