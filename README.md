# Simple-Linear-Regression-SLR-

Simple Linear Regression.ipynb shows how Simple Linear Regression is applied on a real world data set

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with Simple Linear Regression (LSR) and see how it is used in practice. Simple Linear Regression only has 2 variables:
- X : independent feature
- Y: dependent feature

Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent feature and one dependent feature using a straigt line. 
- Best to apply Linear Regressin after variable standardization
- Uses Gradient Descent Algortihm to find the best fit line

**Y =wX +B**

- Y = Dependent feature
- X = Independent feature
- w = weight
- b = Bias
